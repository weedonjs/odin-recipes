    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Hummus also spelled hommus or houmous, is a dip of 
        Arab origin, spread, or savory dish made from cooked
        , mashed chickpeas blended with tahini, lemon juice, 
        and garlic. The standard garnish in the Middle 
        East includes olive oil, a few whole chickpeas, 
        parsley, and paprika.</p>
    <p>Popular in Middle Eastern cuisine, it is usually 
        eaten as a dip, with pita bread. In the West, it 
        is now produced industrially, and is often 
        served as a snack or appetizer with crackers.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained, 
            liquid reserved</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 drops sesame oil, or to taste (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Blend garbanzo beans, lemon juice, olive oil, 
            garlic, cumin, salt, and sesame oil in a food 
            processor; stream reserved bean liquid into the 
            mixture as it blends until desired consistency 
            is achieved.</li>
        <li>I usually end up using about half of the bean 
            liquid, so be sure to reserve it!  Also, I like 
            to let the flavors blend for several hours or 
            overnight before serving this.</li>
    </ol>
