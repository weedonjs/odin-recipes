    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Dolma (Turkish for "stuffed") is a family of stuffed 
        dishes associated with Ottoman cuisine, typically 
        made with a filling of rice, minced meat, offal, 
        seafood, fruit, or any combination of these inside a 
        vegetable or a leaf wrapping. Wrapped dolma, 
        specifically, are known as sarma, made by rolling 
        grape, cabbage, or other leaves around the filling. 
        Dolma can be served warm or at room temperature and 
        are common in modern cuisines of regions and nations 
        that once were part of the Ottoman Empire.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>

        <li>2 onions, minced</li>
        <li>1 Â½ cups uncooked white rice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried currants</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons pine nuts</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried mint</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried dill weed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) jar grape leaves, drained and rinsed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. 
            Saute onions until tender. Stir in rice and hot 
            water to cover. Cover and simmer until rice is 
            half cooked, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and stir in tomato paste, 
            currants, pine nuts, cinnamon, mint leaves, dill 
            weed, allspice and cumin. Let mixture cool.</li>
        <li>Prepare a large pot by placing an inverted plate 
            on the bottom; this protects the dolmas from 
            direct heat when steaming.</li>
        <li>Rinse grape leaves in warm water; drain and cut 
            off any stems. Place about 1 teaspoon of the 
            cooled rice mixture in the center of a leaf. 
            Fold in the sides and then roll into a cigar 
            shape. Place in prepared pot. Repeat with 
            remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>Pour in just enough warm water to reach the 
            bottom of the first layer of dolmas. Cover and 
            simmer over low heat for 30 to 45 minutes, or 
            until rice is totally cooked. Check the water 
            level often and add more as necessary.</li>
    </ol>
