    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Falafel is a deep-fried ball or patty-shaped fritter 
        in Middle Eastern cuisine (especially in Levantine 
        and Egyptian cuisines) made from ground chickpeas, 
        broad beans, or both. Nowadays, falafel is often 
        served in a pita, samoon, or wrapped in a flatbread 
        known as taboon; "falafel" also frequently refers to 
        a wrapped sandwich that is prepared in this way. The 
        falafel balls may be topped with salads, pickled 
        vegetables, hot sauce, and drizzled with tahini-based 
        sauces. Falafel balls may also be eaten alone as a 
        snack or served as part of a meze tray 
        (assortment of appetizers).</p>
    <p>Falafel is eaten throughout the Middle East and is a 
        common street food. Falafel is usually made with fava 
        beans in Egypt, where it most likely originated, and 
        with chickpeas in the Levant, Iraq and Bahrain. It is 
        popular with vegetarians worldwide.</p>
