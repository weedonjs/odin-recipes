    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Falafel is a deep-fried ball or patty-shaped fritter 
        in Middle Eastern cuisine (especially in Levantine 
        and Egyptian cuisines) made from ground chickpeas, 
        broad beans, or both. Nowadays, falafel is often 
        served in a pita, samoon, or wrapped in a flatbread 
        known as taboon; "falafel" also frequently refers to 
        a wrapped sandwich that is prepared in this way. The 
        falafel balls may be topped with salads, pickled 
        vegetables, hot sauce, and drizzled with tahini-based 
        sauces. Falafel balls may also be eaten alone as a 
        snack or served as part of a meze tray 
        (assortment of appetizers).</p>
    <p>Falafel is eaten throughout the Middle East and is a 
        common street food. Falafel is usually made with fava 
        beans in Egypt, where it most likely originated, and 
        with chickpeas in the Levant, Iraq and Bahrain. It is 
        popular with vegetarians worldwide.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup dry garbanzo beans</li>
        <li>½ yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>4 cloves minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place garbanzo beans into a large container and 
            cover with several inches of cool water; let 
            stand 12 to 24 hours. Drain.</li>
        <li>Blend garbanzo beans, onion, parsley, garlic, 
            flour, lemon juice, salt, cumin, coriander, 
            baking soda, and cayenne pepper together in a 
            food processor, scraping down the sides of the 
            bowl as necessary, until mixture is finely ground 
            and holds together when pressed. Transfer 
            garbanzo mixture to a bowl, cover with plastic 
            wrap, and refrigerate until flavors blend, 1 to 2 
            hours.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 
            degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 12 portions and roll each with 
            moistened hands into a ball.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, cook falafel balls in hot oil 
            until browned and crispy, about 5 minutes. Transfer 
            to a wire rack to drain.</li>
    </ol>
